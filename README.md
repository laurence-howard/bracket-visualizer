## Bracket Visualizer

This is a React project in which you can define a set of teams in a knockout bracket.

There are parts to this app, the config page is where you can choose which team is part of which match and who the winner is. The bracket page shows the bracket. The generate page allows you to generate a new bracket from scratch.

This project uses React, Typescript, Next js and Ramda.

It was build by Laurence Howard as part of [12 Little Projects](https://www.12littleprojects.com/).
